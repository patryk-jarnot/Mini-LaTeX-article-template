# Minimalistic LaTeX article template
This is a basic LaTeX template that you can use without any limitations.
I use it for my projects as a starting template for articles, supplementaries and other documents.
Further you can replace it to a template provided by a journal or, in the case of a supplementary material, submit it as it is.

The project has a Makefile, so you can simply type the command below to build pdf file.

```[bash]
make
```
